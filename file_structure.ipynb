    "Many common tutorials tell you how to work with a single file, but a new student might quickly want to scale up beyond a single text. This is not always immediately intuitive. So the following section helps you turn that corner. For the purposes of what follows, in this cookbook repository we have a folder 'corpus' with three texts by Virginia Woolf in it as well as some other texts used elsewhere in the cookbook. If you follow steps listed in the [Set up](set_up.ipynb) section, you might also have a corpus folder, in which case the scripts should be fairly easy to transfer. \n",

Of course, you can [expand glob's functionality](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-use-glob-function-to-find-files-recursively-in-python/) to just that if you wish.

A file whose name is prefixed with a dot will be generally hidden from the graphical user interface (GUI). ie. you won't see that file in the desktop. Normally this is fine, but sometimes they can unexpectedly cause issues when working with the file structure from within Python. In particular, .DS_Store is a hidden file produced by Macs and that stores information about the current view (the computer has to store the fact that you want to view a window as icons somewhere!). You'll want to ignore those files that start with hidden characters so that you only work with the ones you care about. After all, Python is fairly rigid unless you make it flexible. So if your program expects all .txt files but finds a dot file it will error. \n",
